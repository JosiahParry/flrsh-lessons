# Outline {.reading}

- in the last chapter we saw data.table act as the backend for dplyr.
- the difference was with the data source. this is the pattern to keey an eye out for! 
- we create a connection to a data source 
- we build up instructions to query it with dplyr syntax
- we tell it to execute 
- bring the results into memory
