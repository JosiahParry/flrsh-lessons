["<h1 class=\"reading\" id=\"making-dplyr-lazy\">Making dplyr lazy</h1>","<p>dplyr extends this concept of this laziness to data.frames and tables more generally. We’ll explore the concept of lazy tables through the package <a href=\"https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/\"><code>{dtplyr}</code></a>.</p>","<p>In the R community there has been this debate of base R versus dplyr versus data.table for years now. It is <em>very</em> divisive. It’s so divisive that I actually lost a job at DataCamp because of it. Though that’s a story to be shared over a beer.</p>","<p><a href=\"https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/\"><code>data.table</code></a> is another data.frame oriented data manipulation package. It is indisputably, until recently with the publication of <a href=\"https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/\"><code>collapse</code></a>, the fastest in memory data.frame manipulation package in the R ecosystem. However, to use data.table, one has to learn a fairly idiosyncratic “i, j, by” syntax (data.table uses super-powered version of base R’s bracket indexing). Learning a new syntax can be a deterrent which is why I think data.table is not as widely adopted as perhaps ought to be.</p>"]
