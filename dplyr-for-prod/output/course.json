With `dplyr`, the same code can scale from a few thousand rows, tens of thousands, to millions of rows all with very little changes.\n\nIn this course I teach you about eager and lazy evaluation. The `{dtplyr}` package is introduced and used to illustrate how simple dplyr code can be scaled without any changes.\n",

The dplyr API ecosystem includes packages like dbplyr, multidplyr, and sparklyr, which enable execution of dplyr code in different environments."
