["<h1 class=\"reading\" id=\"performance-matters\">Performance matters</h1>","<p>I don’t know if you could tell the difference from this one example, but I can assure you, it <em>is</em> faster. Let’s take a look by creating a <a href=\"https://bench.r-lib.org/\"><code>bench::mark()</code></a>.</p>","<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note</strong></p>\n<p><code>bench::mark()</code> works by providing named expressions that are each evaluated and time multiple times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>","<div class=\"cell\">\n<pre class=\"r cell-code\"><code>bench::mark(\n  dplyr = {\n    flights |&gt;\n      filter(carrier == \"AA\") |&gt;\n      count(origin, dest) |&gt;\n      arrange(origin, desc(dest))\n  },\n  dt = fl[carrier == \"AA\", .N, by = .(origin, dest)][order(origin, -dest)],\n  check = FALSE\n)</code></pre>\n</div>","<p>In this bench mark, data.table is just about 4.5 times <em>faster</em> than dplyr! That’s nothing to scoff at. Maybe even more significantly, data.table used far less memory! Sure, 10mb isn’t too much now. But what about when we’re working with 10 million rows in memory? You <em>will</em> feel the difference then.</p>"]
