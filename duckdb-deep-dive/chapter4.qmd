persistence is the key
out-of-core processing
why i recommend duckdb over duckplyr
the true scalability of duckdb 

- duckdb file format

# Bulk importing CSV

if you have a lot of data in csv files
you can import it into your duckdb database use duckdb_read_csv() iterativeyl

" This usually is much faster than reading the data into R and writing it to DuckDB."

- `duckdb_read_csv()`
